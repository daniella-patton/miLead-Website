## Project title
A simple professional website created to host training modules for a UM consulting club.
Website Link: http://mileadtraining-env.eba-3rbm2m3j.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/

## Motivation
This website was created in collaboration with miLead, a consulting club at the University of Michigan. 
This website was the product of a two month project where a team of 10 consultants (2 managers and 8 consultants) created training modules covering topics ranging from powerpoint design to market analysis. These modules were prepared specifically for new members who have little to no experience.

Each training module contains an interactive powerpoint, a qualtrics assesment, and a white paper and was desgned to take ~ 30 min per module. 

This code has been scrubbed so that all miLead owned private information can not be replicated.

This website was created using Flask and was deployed on AWS. The website used bootstrap and was customized using html. 

In order to access this website, the correct username and password must be entered in the login page.

#### Example login page:

## How to use?
Run application.py in your terminal to view the website. The preset usernmame and password are 'Your Username' and 'Your Password', respectively.
Use this file to identify the html files corresponding to each page. Make edits (e.g., add images, powerpoint slides, pdfs, and text to personalize this for your own use). A single pdf and ppt slide has been uploaded for your reference.

To host your website on AWS simply compress all files and upload using elastic beanstalk.
