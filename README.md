# miLead-Website
A website created to host training modules for a UM consulting club.

This website was created in collaboration with miLead, a consulting club at the University of Michigan. 
This website was the product of a two month project where a team of 10 consultants (2 managers and 8 consultants) who created training modules covering topics ranging from powerpoint design to market analysis. 

Each training module contained an interactive powerpoint, a qualtrics assesment, and a white paper and should take 30 - 40 minutes each. 

All miLead training modules have been removed from the github code....
