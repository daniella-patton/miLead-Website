# miLead-Website
A website created to host training modules for a UM consulting club.

This website was created in collaboration with miLead, a consulting club at the University of Michigan. 
This website was the product of a two month project where a team of 10 consultants (2 managers and 8 consultants) created training modules covering topics ranging from powerpoint design to market analysis. These modules were prepared specifically for new members of the club who have little to no experience in consulting =.

Each training module contains an interactive powerpoint, a qualtrics assesment, and a white paper and was desgned to take ~ 30 min per module. 

This code has been scrubbed so that all miLead owned private information can not be replicated.

This website was created using Flask and was deployed on AWS. The website used bootstrap and was customized using html templates.
